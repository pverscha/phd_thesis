## Introduction
*The research presented in this PhD thesis is situated on the verge of computer science and biotechnology.
In order to fully understand and grasp the concepts that are presented throughout this thesis, it is important that I first introduce a set of terms, definitions and techniques that are extensively used throughout this work.*

### Biotechnological concepts

#### The central dogma in biology
Every organism in our universe is made up of cells that contain the instructions that define what the organism is, how it behaves and how new cells should be created.
All cells contains an exact copy of these instructions.
These instructions can be compared with a recipe book that describes and instructs a cook to bake a specific kind of cake.
All recipes are collected in this book, and every cell has an exact copy of this recipe collection.
Whenever a client in the restaurants requests a dish, the request is sent to the kitchen where the cook selects the appropriate recipe from the recipe book and starts making the dish.

This is a simple analogy to explain how DNA and RNA are used in the cells of an organism to create new proteins.
Our book of recipes stands for the DNA that is present in every cell.
RNA, subsequently, can be regarded as a copy of a single recipe in the book, while the final dish itself corresponds to a single protein.

We can continue to use this analogy to explain how exactly this central dogma of biology takes place in a living organism.
The first step in making a dish is to choose a recipe from the book.
This process is called **transcription**.
In transcription, a section of DNA is copied into an RNA-sequence (more specifically messenger-RNA, or mRNA), which serves as a template for building proteins.

Next, all of the necessary ingredients for the dish are gathered.
These can be thought of as the raw materials that are needed to build a protein.
For proteins specifically, these raw materials are amino acids, which are brought to the site of protein synthesis by a molecule called transfer-RNA (or tRNA).

Once all of the ingredients have been delivered to the construction site, the cell follows the instructions in the encoded recipe (or thus the instructions encoded by a strand of messenger-RNA, or mRNA).
This process is called **translation**.
In translation, this mRNA template is read by a ribosome, which assembles amino acids in the correct order to form a protein.

The concept explained above, is called the **central dogma of biology**.
It is one of the most fundamental principles of the molecular biology and was depicted by Francis Crick in 1958 and which was reformulated in a manuscript published in Nature in 1970 [@crickCentralDogmaMolecular1970].
The central dogma explains how proteins in organisms are constructed and is very important to grasp in order to understand a lot of the basic principles of biology.

##### DNA
DNA stands for DeoxyriboNucleic Acid and, as explained above, contains the instructions on how all proteins in an organism can be constructed.
The complete DNA of an organism is present in every cell of this organism and is organised in chemical structures that we call **chromosomes**.
These so-called chromosomes always appear in pairs (humans, for example, have 23 pairs of chromosomes).

A gene is a well-defined piece of the DNA that corresponds to the instructions required to construct one specific protein (and thus corresponds with one recipe of our book of recipes analogy that we used earlier).

The DNA is made up of a sequence of nucleotides (simple molecules that can be chained together) that are represented by the four letters A, C, G and T.

##### RNA
RNA stands for RiboNucleic Acid and
