  abstract = {Motivation: One of the major problems in shotgun proteomics is the low peptide coverage when analyzing complex protein samples. Identifying more peptides, e.g. non-tryptic peptides, may increase the peptide coverage and improve protein identification and/or quantification that are based on the peptide identification results. Searching for all potential non-tryptic peptides is, however, time consuming for shotgun proteomics data from complex samples, and poses a challenge for a routine data analysis.Results: We hypothesize that non-tryptic peptides are mainly created from the truncation of regular tryptic peptides before separation. We introduce the notion of truncatability of a tryptic peptide, i.e. the probability of the peptide to be identified in its truncated form, and build a predictor to estimate a peptide's truncatability from its sequence. We show that our predictions achieve useful accuracy, with the area under the ROC curve from 76\% to 87\%, and can be used to filter the sequence database for identifying truncated peptides. After filtering, only a limited number of tryptic peptides with the highest truncatability are retained for non-tryptic peptide searching. By applying this method to identification of semi-tryptic peptides, we show that a significant number of such peptides can be identified within a searching time comparable to that of tryptic peptide identification.Contact:predrag@indiana.edu; rarnold@indiana.edu; hatang@indiana.edu},

  abstract = {Background The composition of the salivary microbiota has been reported to differentiate between patients with periodontitis, dental caries and orally healthy individuals. To identify characteristics of diseased and healthy saliva we thus wanted to compare saliva metaproteomes from patients with periodontitis and dental caries to healthy individuals. Methods Stimulated saliva samples were collected from 10 patients with periodontitis, 10 patients with dental caries and 10 orally healthy individuals. The proteins in the saliva samples were subjected to denaturing buffer and digested enzymatically with LysC and trypsin. The resulting peptide mixtures were cleaned up by solid-phase extraction and separated online with 2 h gradients by nano-scale C18 reversed-phase chromatography connected to a mass spectrometer through an electrospray source. The eluting peptides were analyzed on a tandem mass spectrometer operated in data-dependent acquisition mode. Results We identified a total of 35,664 unique peptides from 4,161 different proteins, of which 1,946 and 2,090 were of bacterial and human origin, respectively. The human protein profiles displayed significant overexpression of the complement system and inflammatory markers in periodontitis and dental caries compared to healthy controls. Bacterial proteome profiles and functional annotation were very similar in health and disease. Conclusions Overexpression of proteins related to the complement system and inflammation seems to correlate with oral disease status. Similar bacterial proteomes in healthy and diseased individuals suggests that the salivary microbiota predominantly thrives in a planktonic state expressing no disease-associated characteristics of metabolic activity.},

  abstract = {To date, reliable tests enabling the identification of celiac disease (CD) patients at a greater risk of developing poly-autoimmune diseases are not yet available. We therefore aimed to identify non-invasive microbial biomarkers, useful to implement diagnosis of poly-autoimmunity. Twenty CD patients with poly-autoimmunity (cases) and 30 matched subjects affected exclusively by CD (controls) were selected. All patients followed a varied gluten-free diet for at least 1 year. Fecal microbiota composition was characterized using bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing. Significant differences in gut microbiota composition between CD patients with and without poly-autoimmune disease were found using the edgeR algorithm. Spearman correlations between gut microbiota and clinical, demographic, and anthropometric data were also examined. A significant reduction of Bacteroides, Ruminococcus, and Veillonella abundances was found in CD patients with poly-autoimmunity compared to the controls. Bifidobacterium was specifically reduced in CD patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis and its abundance correlated negatively with abdominal circumference values in patients affected exclusively by CD. In addition, the duration of CD correlated with the abundance of Firmicutes (negatively) and Odoribacter (positively), whereas the abundance of Desulfovibrionaceae correlated positively with the duration of poly-autoimmunity. This study provides supportive evidence that specific variations of gut microbial taxa occur in CD patients with poly-autoimmune diseases. These findings open the way to future validation studies on larger cohorts, which might in turn lead to promising diagnostic applications.},

  abstract = {The gut microbiome plays a fundamental role in the human host's overall health by contributing key biological functions such as expanded metabolism and pathogen defense/immune control. In a healthy individual, the gut microbiome co-exists within the human host in a symbiotic, non-inflammatory relationship that enables mutual benefits, such as microbial degradation of indigestible food products into small molecules that the host can utilize, and enhanced pathogen defense. In abnormal conditions, such as Crohn's disease, this favorable metabolic relationship breaks down and a variety of undesirable activities result, including chronic inflammation and other health-related issues. It has been difficult, however, to elucidate the overall functional characteristics of this relationship because the microbiota can vary substantially in composition for healthy humans and possibly even more in individuals with gut disease conditions such as Crohn's disease. Overall, this suggests that microbial membership composition may not be the best way to characterize a phenotype. Alternatively, it seems to be more informative to examine and characterize the functional composition of a gut microbiome. Towards that end, this study examines 25 metaproteomes measured in several Crohn's disease patients' post-resection surgery across the course of 1\,year, in order to examine persistence of microbial taxa, genes, proteins, and metabolic functional distributions across time in individuals whose microbiome might be more variable due to the gut disease condition.},

This is especially problematic for fledgling open searches, which will benefit from accurate retention time prediction for modified peptides to reduce identification ambiguity. We present DeepLC, a deep learning peptide retention time predictor using peptide encoding based on atomic composition that allows the retention time of (previously unseen) modified peptides to be predicted accurately. We show that DeepLC performs similarly to current state-of-the-art approaches for unmodified peptides and, more importantly, accurately predicts retention times for modifications not seen during training. Moreover, we show that DeepLC's ability to predict retention times for any modification enables potentially incorrect identifications to be flagged in an open search of a wide variety of proteome data.},

  abstract = {Classical approaches for analyzing reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) data commonly require normalization before assessing differential expression (DE). Normalization often has a substantial effect on the interpretation and validity of the subsequent analysis steps, but at the same time it causes a reduction in variance and introduces dependence among the normalized outcomes. These effects can be substantial, however, they are typically ignored. Most normalization techniques and methods for DE focus on mean expression and are sensitive to outliers. Moreover, in cancer studies, for example, oncogenes are often only expressed in a subsample of the populations during sampling. This primarily affects the skewness and the tails of the distribution and the mean is therefore not necessarily the best effect size measure within these experimental setups. In our contribution, we propose an extension of the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test which incorporates a robust normalization, and the uncertainty associated with normalization is propagated into the final statistical summaries for DE. Our method relies on semiparametric regression models that focus on the probability P\{Y {$\leq$} Y'\}, where Y and Y' denote independent responses for different subject groups. This effect size is robust to outliers, while remaining informative and intuitive when DE affects the shape of the distribution instead of only the mean. We also extend our approach for assessing DE for multiple features simultaneously. Simulation studies show that the test has a good performance, and that it is very competitive with standard methods for this platform. The method is illustrated on two neuroblastoma studies.},

We call the data structure opportunistic since its space occupancy is decreased when the input is compressible and this space reduction is achieved at no significant slowdown in the query performance. More precisely, its space occupancy is optimal in an information-content sense because text T[1,u] is stored using O(H/sub k/(T))+o(1) bits per input symbol in the worst case, where H/sub k/(T) is the kth order empirical entropy of T (the bound holds for any fixed k). Given an arbitrary string P[1,p], the opportunistic data structure allows to search for the occurrences of P in T in O(p+occlog/sup /spl epsiv//u) time (for any fixed /spl epsiv/{$>$}0). If data are uncompressible we achieve the best space bound currently known (Grossi and Vitter, 2000); on compressible data our solution improves the succinct suffix array of (Grossi and Vitter, 2000) and the classical suffix tree and suffix array data structures either in space or in query time or both. We also study our opportunistic data structure in a dynamic setting and devise a variant achieving effective search and update time bounds. Finally, we show how to plug our opportunistic data structure into the Glimpse tool (Manber and Wu, 1994). The result is an indexing tool which achieves sublinear space and sublinear query time complexity.},

The recently developed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) technology has generated much excitement in part due to claims of reduced variability in comparison to microarrays. However, we show that RNA-seq data demonstrate unwanted and obscuring variability similar to what was first observed in microarrays. In particular, we find guanine-cytosine content (GC-content) has a strong sample-specific effect on gene expression measurements that, if left uncorrected, leads to false positives in downstream results. We also report on commonly observed data distortions that demonstrate the need for data normalization. Here, we describe a statistical methodology that improves precision by 42\% without loss of accuracy. Our resulting conditional quantile normalization algorithm combines robust generalized regression to remove systematic bias introduced by deterministic features such as GC-content and quantile normalization to correct for global distortions.},

  abstract = {The production of biogas by anaerobic digestion (AD) of agricultural residues, organic wastes, animal excrements, municipal sludge, and energy crops has a firm place in sustainable energy production and bio-economy strategies. Focusing on the microbial community involved in biomass conversion offers the opportunity to control and engineer the biogas process with the objective to optimize its efficiency. Taxonomic profiling of biogas producing communities by means of high-throughput 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing provided high-resolution insights into bacterial and archaeal structures of AD assemblages and their linkages to fed substrates and process parameters. Commonly, the bacterial phyla Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes appeared to dominate biogas communities in varying abundances depending on the apparent process conditions. Regarding the community of methanogenic Archaea, their diversity was mainly affected by the nature and composition of the substrates, availability of nutrients and ammonium/ammonia contents, but not by the temperature. It also appeared that a high proportion of 16S rRNA sequences can only be classified on higher taxonomic ranks indicating that many community members and their participation in AD within functional networks are still unknown. Although cultivation-based approaches to isolate microorganisms from biogas fermentation samples yielded hundreds of novel species and strains, this approach intrinsically is limited to the cultivable fraction of the community. To obtain genome sequence information of non-cultivable biogas community members, metagenome sequencing including assembly and binning strategies was highly valuable. Corresponding research has led to the compilation of hundreds of metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) frequently representing novel taxa whose metabolism and lifestyle could be reconstructed based on nucleotide sequence information. In contrast to metagenome analyses revealing the genetic potential of microbial communities, metatranscriptome sequencing provided insights into the metabolically active community. Taking advantage of genome sequence information, transcriptional activities were evaluated considering the microorganism's genetic background. Metaproteome studies uncovered enzyme profiles expressed by biogas community members. Enzymes involved in cellulose and hemicellulose decomposition and utilization of other complex biopolymers were identified. Future studies on biogas functional microbial networks will increasingly involve integrated multi-omics analyses evaluating metagenome, transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome datasets.},

  abstract = {Metagenomics is the study of the genomic content of a sample of organisms obtained from a common habitat using targeted or random sequencing. Goals include understanding the extent and role of microbial diversity. The taxonomical content of such a sample is usually estimated by comparison against sequence databases of known sequences. Most published studies use the analysis of paired-end reads, complete sequences of environmental fosmid and BAC clones, or environmental assemblies. Emerging sequencing-by-synthesis technologies with very high throughput are paving the way to low-cost random ``shotgun'' approaches. This paper introduces MEGAN, a new computer program that allows laptop analysis of large metagenomic data sets. In a preprocessing step, the set of DNA sequences is compared against databases of known sequences using BLAST or another comparison tool. MEGAN is then used to compute and explore the taxonomical content of the data set, employing the NCBI taxonomy to summarize and order the results. A simple lowest common ancestor algorithm assigns reads to taxa such that the taxonomical level of the assigned taxon reflects the level of conservation of the sequence. The software allows large data sets to be dissected without the need for assembly or the targeting of specific phylogenetic markers. It provides graphical and statistical output for comparing different data sets. The approach is applied to several data sets, including the Sargasso Sea data set, a recently published metagenomic data set sampled from a mammoth bone, and several complete microbial genomes. Also, simulations that evaluate the performance of the approach for different read lengths are presented.},

  abstract = {Finding approximate occurrences of a pattern in a text using a full-text index is a central problem in bioinformatics and has been extensively researched. Bidirectional indices have opened new possibilities in this regard allowing the search to start from anywhere within the pattern and extend in both directions. In particular, use of search schemes (partitioning the pattern and searching the pieces in certain orders with given bounds on errors) can yield significant speed-ups. However, finding optimal search schemes is a difficult combinatorial optimization problem. Here for the first time, we propose a mixed integer program (MIP) capable to solve this optimization problem for Hamming distance with given number of pieces. Our experiments show that the optimal search schemes found by our MIP significantly improve the performance of search in bidirectional FM-index upon previous ad-hoc solutions. For example, approximate matching of 101-bp Illumina reads (with two errors) becomes 35 times faster than standard backtracking. Moreover, despite being performed purely in the index, the running time of search using our optimal schemes (for up to two errors) is comparable to the best state-of-the-art aligners, which benefit from combining search in index with in-text verification using dynamic programming. As a result, we anticipate a full-fledged aligner that employs an intelligent combination of search in the bidirectional FM-index using our optimal search schemes and in-text verification using dynamic programming outperforms today's best aligners. The development of such an aligner, called FAMOUS (Fast Approximate string Matching using OptimUm search Schemes), is ongoing as our future work.},

The gut microbiome is a dynamic environment which is crucial for overall health and fitness. Imbalances in the gut microbiome can influence nutrient absorption, pathogen resistance, inflammation, and various human diseases. Metaproteomic analysis of the gut microbiome is currently being performed on bacteria isolated from (1) fecal samples (2) colonic lavage, or (3) colon biopsies. Investigation of the gut microbiome has demonstrated that within the colon, there are distinct communities based on spatial location, and separable from the gut microbiomes isolated from stool. In addition to expanding our understanding of host\textendash bacterial interactions for human health and disease, gut microbiome analysis is being utilized for biomarker development to discriminate normal individuals and diseased (i.e., inflammatory bowel disease or colon cancer) patients as well as to monitor disease activity and prognosis.},

A core step of these applications is to align an enormous amount of short reads to a reference genome.

Based on existing indexing and pattern matching technologies, several short read alignment software have been developed recently. Yet this is still strong need to further improve the speed. In this paper, we show a new indexing data structure called bi-directional BWT, which allows us to build the fastest software for aligning short reads. When compared with existing software (Bowtie is the best), our software is at least 3 times faster for finding unique best alignments, and 25 times faster for finding all possible alignments. We believe that bi-directional BWT is an interesting data structure on its own and could be applied to other pattern matching problems.},

This rank data structures allows search steps in constant time for unidirectional and bidirectional FM indices. To our knowledge this is the first and only constant-time implementation of a bidirectional FM index at the time of writing. We show that its running time is not only optimal in theory, but currently also outperforms all available FM index implementations in practice.
 
 Second, we cover approximate string matching in bidirectional indices. To improve the running time and make higher error rates suitable for index-based searches, we introduce an integer linear program for finding optimal search strategies. We show that it is significantly faster than other search strategies in indices and cover additional improvements such as hybrid approaches of index-based searches with in-text verification, i.e., at some point the partially matched string is located and verified directly in the text.
 
 Finally, we present a yet unpublished algorithm for fast computation of the mappability of genomic sequences. Mappability is a measure for the uniqueness of a genome by counting how often each \$k\$-mer of the sequence occurs with a certain error threshold in the genome itself. We suggest two applications of mappability with prototype implementations: First, a read mapper incorporating the mappability information to improve the running time when mapping reads that match highly repetitive regions, and second, we use the mappability information to identify phylogenetic markers in a set of similar strains of the same species by the example of E. coli. Unique regions allow identifying and distinguishing even highly similar strains using unassembled sequencing data.
 
 The findings in this thesis can speed up many applications in bioinformatics as we demonstrate for read mapping and computation of mappability, and give suggestions for further research in this field.},

  abstract = {In this study, the impact of protein fractionation techniques prior to LC/MS analysis was investigated on activated sludge samples derived at winter and summer condition from a full-scale wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). For reduction of the sample complexity, different fractionation techniques including RP-LC (1D-approach), SDS-PAGE and RP-LC (2D-approach) as well as RP-LC, SDS-PAGE and liquid IEF (3D-approach) were carried out before subsequent ion trap MS analysis. The derived spectra were identified by MASCOT search using a combination of the public UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot protein database and metagenome data from a WWTP. The results showed a significant increase of identified spectra, enabled by applying IEF and SDS-PAGE to the proteomic workflow. Based on meta-proteins, a core metaproteome and a corresponding taxonomic profile of the wastewater activated sludge were described. Functional aspects were analyzed using the KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathway library by plotting KEGG Orthology identifiers (KO numbers) of protein hits into pathway maps of the central carbon (map01200) and nitrogen metabolism (map00910). Using the 3D-approach, most proteins involved in glycolysis and citrate cycle and nearly all proteins of the nitrogen removal were identified, qualifying this approach as most promising for future studies. All MS data have been deposited in the ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD001547 (http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/dataset/PXD001547).},

Metaproteomics is also attracting considerable attention, and such data can be efficiently generated today owing to improvements in mass spectrometry-based proteomics. As we will discuss in this study, there are still major challenges notably in data analysis that need to be overcome. Here, we analyzed 212 fecal samples from 56 hospitalized acute leukemia patients with multidrug-resistant Enterobactericeae (MRE) gut colonization using metagenomics and metaproteomics. This is one of the largest clinical metaproteomic studies to date, and the first metaproteomic study addressing the gut microbiome in MRE colonized acute leukemia patients. Based on this substantial data set, we discuss major current limitations in clinical metaproteomic data analysis to provide guidance to researchers in the field. Notably, the results show that public metagenome databases are incomplete and that sample-specific metagenomes improve results. Furthermore, biological variation is tremendous which challenges clinical study designs and argues that longitudinal measurements of individual patients are a valuable future addition to the analysis of patient cohorts.},

We have now a foreseeable future in which most bacterial species will have an annotated genome. However, we know also that most prokaryotic diversity would not be included there. On the one hand, there is the problem of many groups not being easily amenable to culture and hence not represented in culture-centred microbial taxonomy. On the other hand, the gene pools present in one species can be orders of magnitude larger that the genome of one strain (selected for genome sequencing). Contrasting with eukaryotic genomes, the repertoire of genes present in one prokaryotic cell genome does not correlate stringently with its taxonomic identity. Hence gene catalogues from one environment might provide more meaningful information than the classical species catalogues. Metagenomics or microbial environmental genomics provide a different tool that gravitates around the habitat rather than the species. Such tool could be just the right way to complement `organismal genomics'. Its potential to advance our understanding of microbial ecology and prokaryotic diversity and evolution is discussed.},

Future methodological developments could provide new capabilities such as characterizing long-term ecosystem changes, biogeochemical reaction rates, and in situ stoichiometries.

However, severe challenges remain that are highlighted and discussed in this article; these include: (i) robust false-positive assessment of peptide and protein identifications, (ii) complex protein inference against a background of highly redundant data, (iii) taxonomic and functional post-processing of identification data, and finally, (iv) the assessment and provision of metrics and tools for quantitative analysis.},

  abstract = {Metaproteomics enables the investigation of the protein repertoire expressed by complex microbial communities. However, to unleash its full potential, refinements in bioinformatic approaches for data analysis are still needed. In this context, sequence databases selection represents a major challenge. This work assessed the impact of different databases in metaproteomic investigations by using a mock microbial mixture including nine diverse bacterial and eukaryotic species, which was subjected to shotgun metaproteomic analysis. Then, both the microbial mixture and the single microorganisms were subjected to next generation sequencing to obtain experimental metagenomic- and genomic-derived databases, which were used along with public databases (namely, NCBI, UniProtKB/SwissProt and UniProtKB/TrEMBL, parsed at different taxonomic levels) to analyze the metaproteomic dataset. First, a quantitative comparison in terms of number and overlap of peptide identifications was carried out among all databases. As a result, only 35\% of peptides were common to all database classes; moreover, genus/species-specific databases provided up to 17\% more identifications compared to databases with generic taxonomy, while the metagenomic database enabled a slight increment in respect to public databases. Then, database behavior in terms of false discovery rate and peptide degeneracy was critically evaluated. Public databases with generic taxonomy exhibited a markedly different trend compared to the counterparts. Finally, the reliability of taxonomic attribution according to the lowest common ancestor approach (using MEGAN and Unipept software) was assessed. The level of misassignments varied among the different databases, and specific thresholds based on the number of taxon-specific peptides were established to minimize false positives. This study confirms that database selection has a significant impact in metaproteomics, and provides critical indications for improving depth and reliability of metaproteomic results. Specifically, the use of iterative searches and of suitable filters for taxonomic assignments is proposed with the aim of increasing coverage and trustworthiness of metaproteomic data.},

However, little is known regarding the functions exerted by the GM in colon cancer (CC), particularly with respect to tumor clinical classification and lymphocyte infiltration. In addition, stool, usually employed as a proxy of the GM, cannot fully represent the original complexity of CC microenvironment. Here, we present a pilot study aimed at characterizing the metaproteome of CC-associated colonic luminal contents and identifying its possible associations with CC clinicopathological features. Colonic luminal contents were collected from 24 CC tissue specimens immediately after surgery. Samples were analyzed by shotgun metaproteomics. Almost 30,000 microbial peptides were quantified in the samples, enabling the achievement of the taxonomic and functional profile of the tumor-associated colonic luminal metaproteome. Upon sample aggregation based on tumor stage, grade, or tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), peptide sets enabling discrimination of sample groups were identified through discriminant analysis (DA). As a result, Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides fragilis were significantly enriched in high-stage and high-grade CC, respectively. Among metabolic functions, formate\textendash tetrahydrofolate ligase was significantly associated with high-stage CC. Finally, based on the results of this pilot study, we assessed the optimal sample size for differential metaproteomic studies analyzing colonic luminal contents. In conclusion, we provide a detailed picture of the microbial and host components of the colonic luminal proteome and propose promising associations between GM taxonomic/functional features and CC clinicopathological features. Future studies will be needed to verify the prognostic value of these data and to fully exploit the potential of metaproteomics in enhancing our knowledge concerning CC progression.},

  abstract = {Gene expression is the fundamental level at which the results of various genetic and regulatory programs are observable. The measurement of transcriptome-wide gene expression has convincingly switched from microarrays to sequencing in a matter of years. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) provides a quantitative and open system for profiling transcriptional outcomes on a large scale and therefore facilitates a large diversity of applications, including basic science studies, but also agricultural or clinical situations. In the past 10 years or so, much has been learned about the characteristics of the RNA-seq data sets, as well as the performance of the myriad of methods developed. In this review, we give an overview of the developments in RNA-seq data analysis, including experimental design, with an explicit focus on the quantification of gene expression and statistical approachesfor differential expression. We also highlight emerging data types, such as single-cell RNA-seq and gene expression profiling using long-read technologies.},

We propose stageR, a two-stage testing paradigm that leverages the increased power of aggregated gene-level tests and allows post hoc assessment for significant genes. This method provides gene-level FDR control and boosts power for testing interaction effects. In transcript-level analysis, it provides a framework that performs powerful gene-level tests while maintaining biological interpretation at transcript-level resolution. The procedure is applicable whenever individual hypotheses can be aggregated, providing a unified framework for complex high-throughput experiments.},

While many metaproteomic workflows are available, the impact of method choice on results remains unclear. Here, we carry out a community-driven, multi-laboratory comparison in metaproteomics: the critical assessment of metaproteome investigation study (CAMPI). Based on well-established workflows, we evaluate the effect of sample preparation, mass spectrometry, and bioinformatic analysis using two samples: a simplified, laboratory-assembled human intestinal model and a human fecal sample. We observe that variability at the peptide level is predominantly due to sample processing workflows, with a smaller contribution of bioinformatic pipelines. These peptide-level differences largely disappear at the protein group level. While differences are observed for predicted community composition, similar functional profiles are obtained across workflows. CAMPI demonstrates the robustness of present-day metaproteomics research, serves as a template for multi-laboratory studies in metaproteomics, and provides publicly available data sets for benchmarking future developments.},

Next to the existing taxonomic analysis, version 2.0 of the API and CLI provides access to Unipept's powerful functional analysis for metaproteomics samples. The functional analysis pipeline supports retrieval of Enzyme Commission numbers, Gene Ontology terms and InterPro entries for the individual peptides in a metaproteomics sample. This paves the way for other applications and developers to integrate these new information sources into their data processing pipelines, which greatly increases insight into the functions performed by the organisms in a specific environment. Both the API and CLI have also been expanded with the ability to render interactive visualizations from a list of taxon ids. These visualizations are automatically made available on a dedicated website and can easily be shared by users.The API is available at http://api.unipept.ugent.be.

Here we address this problem by introducing a new type of seeds: the 01⁎0 seeds. These seeds are made of two exact parts separated by parts with exactly one error. We show that those seeds are lossless, and we apply them to two filtration algorithms for two popular applications, one where a compressed index is built on the text and another one where the patterns are indexed. We also demonstrate experimentally the advantages of our approach compared to alternative methods implementing other types of seeds. This work opens the way to the design of more efficient and more sensitive text algorithms.},

In microbiology, these `omic' approaches have largely been limited to pure cultures of microorganisms. Consequently, they do not provide information on gene expression in a complex mixture of microorganisms as found in the environment. Our method enabled the successful extraction and purification of the entire proteome from a laboratory-scale activated sludge system optimized for enhanced biological phosphorus removal, its separation by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and the mapping of this metaproteome. Highly expressed protein spots were excised and identified using quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry with de novo peptide sequencing. The proteins isolated were putatively identified as an outer membrane protein (porin), an acetyl coenzyme A acetyltransferase and a protein component of an ABC-type branched-chain amino acid transport system. These proteins possibly stem from the dominant and uncultured Rhodocyclus-type polyphosphate-accumulating organism in the activated sludge. We propose the term `metaproteomics' for the large-scale characterization of the entire protein complement of environmental microbiota at a given point in time.},

A decade has passed since the term ``metaproteomics'' was first coined and corresponding analyses were carried out on mixed microbial communities. Since then metaproteomics has yielded many important insights into microbial ecosystem function in the various environmental settings where it has been applied. Although initial progress in analytical capacities and resulting numbers of proteins identified was extremely fast, this trend slowed rapidly. Here, we discuss several representative metaproteomic investigations of activated sludge, acid mine drainage biofilms, freshwater and seawater microbial communities, soil, and human gut microbiota. By using these case studies, we highlight current challenges and possible solutions for metaproteomics to realize its full potential, i.e. to enable conclusive links between microbial community composition, physiology, function, interactions, ecology, and evolution in situ.},

We examined how such proteins partition into soluble urine (SU) and urinary pellet (UP) fractions by analyzing 33 urine specimens 12 of which were associated with a urinary tract infection (UTI). Using mass spectrometry-based metaproteomic approaches, we identified 5,327 non-redundant human proteins, 2,638 and 4,379 of which were associated with SU and UP fractions, respectively, and 1,206 non-redundant protein orthology groups derived from pathogenic and commensal organisms of the urogenital tract. Differences between the SU and UP proteomes were influenced by local inflammation, supported by respective comparisons with 12 healthy control urine proteomes. Clustering analyses showed that SU and UP fractions had proteomic signatures discerning UTIs, vascular injury, and epithelial cell exfoliation from the control group to varying degrees. Cases of UTI revealed clusters of proteins produced by activated neutrophils. Network analysis supported the central role of neutrophil effector proteins in the defense against invading pathogens associated with subsequent coagulation and wound repair processes. Our study expands the existing knowledge of the urinary proteome under perturbed conditions, and should be useful as reference dataset in the search of biomarkers.},

In addition, we propose a set of guidelines/recommendations for performing and reporting the results from metaproteomic experiments for the study of human microbiomes.
