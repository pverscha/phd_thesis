  abstract = {Motivation: One of the major problems in shotgun proteomics is the low peptide coverage when analyzing complex protein samples. Identifying more peptides, e.g. non-tryptic peptides, may increase the peptide coverage and improve protein identification and/or quantification that are based on the peptide identification results. Searching for all potential non-tryptic peptides is, however, time consuming for shotgun proteomics data from complex samples, and poses a challenge for a routine data analysis.Results: We hypothesize that non-tryptic peptides are mainly created from the truncation of regular tryptic peptides before separation. We introduce the notion of truncatability of a tryptic peptide, i.e. the probability of the peptide to be identified in its truncated form, and build a predictor to estimate a peptide's truncatability from its sequence. We show that our predictions achieve useful accuracy, with the area under the ROC curve from 76\% to 87\%, and can be used to filter the sequence database for identifying truncated peptides. After filtering, only a limited number of tryptic peptides with the highest truncatability are retained for non-tryptic peptide searching. By applying this method to identification of semi-tryptic peptides, we show that a significant number of such peptides can be identified within a searching time comparable to that of tryptic peptide identification.Contact:predrag@indiana.edu; rarnold@indiana.edu; hatang@indiana.edu},

  abstract = {In mass spectrometry-based shotgun proteomics, protein identifications are usually the desired result. However, most of the analytical methods are based on the identification of reliable peptides and not the direct identification of intact proteins. Thus, assembling peptides identified from tandem mass spectra into a list of proteins, referred to as protein inference, is a critical step in proteomics research. Currently, different protein inference algorithms and tools are available for the proteomics community. Here, we evaluated five software tools for protein inference (PIA, ProteinProphet, Fido, ProteinLP, MSBayesPro) using three popular database search engines: Mascot, X!Tandem, and MS-GF+. All the algorithms were evaluated using a highly customizable KNIME workflow using four different public datasets with varying complexities (different sample preparation, species and analytical instruments). We defined a set of quality control metrics to evaluate the performance of each combination of search engines, protein inference algorithm, and parameters on each dataset. We show that the results for complex samples vary not only regarding the actual numbers of reported protein groups but also concerning the actual composition of groups. Furthermore, the robustness of reported proteins when using databases of differing complexities is strongly dependant on the applied inference algorithm. Finally, merging the identifications of multiple search engines does not necessarily increase the number of reported proteins, but does increase the number of peptides per protein and thus can generally be recommended. Significance Protein inference is one of the major challenges in MS-based proteomics nowadays. Currently, there are a vast number of protein inference algorithms and implementations available for the proteomics community. Protein assembly impacts in the final results of the research, the quantitation values and the final claims in the research manuscript. Even though protein inference is a crucial step in proteomics data analysis, a comprehensive evaluation of the many different inference methods has never been performed. Previously Journal of proteomics has published multiple studies about other benchmark of bioinformatics algorithms (PMID: 26585461; PMID: 22728601) in proteomics studies making clear the importance of those studies for the proteomics community and the journal audience. This manuscript presents a new bioinformatics solution based on the KNIME/OpenMS platform that aims at providing a fair comparison of protein inference algorithms (https://github.com/KNIME-OMICS). Six different algorithms - ProteinProphet, MSBayesPro, ProteinLP, Fido and PIA- were evaluated using the highly customizable workflow on four public datasets with varying complexities. Five popular database search engines Mascot, X!Tandem, MS-GF+ and combinations thereof were evaluated for every protein inference tool. In total {$>$}186 proteins lists were analyzed and carefully compare using three metrics for quality assessments of the protein inference results: 1) the numbers of reported proteins, 2) peptides per protein, and the 3) number of uniquely reported proteins per inference method, to address the quality of each inference method. We also examined how many proteins were reported by choosing each combination of search engines, protein inference algorithms and parameters on each dataset. The results show that using 1) PIA or Fido seems to be a good choice when studying the results of the analyzed workflow, regarding not only the reported proteins and the high-quality identifications, but also the required runtime. 2) Merging the identifications of multiple search engines gives almost always more confident results and increases the number of peptides per protein group. 3) The usage of databases containing not only the canonical, but also known isoforms of proteins has a small impact on the number of reported proteins. The detection of specific isoforms could, concerning the question behind the study, compensate for slightly shorter reports using the parsimonious reports. 4) The current workflow can be easily extended to support new algorithms and search engine combinations.},

To identify characteristics of diseased and healthy saliva we thus wanted to compare saliva metaproteomes from patients with periodontitis and dental caries to healthy individuals. Methods Stimulated saliva samples were collected from 10 patients with periodontitis, 10 patients with dental caries and 10 orally healthy individuals. The proteins in the saliva samples were subjected to denaturing buffer and digested enzymatically with LysC and trypsin. The resulting peptide mixtures were cleaned up by solid-phase extraction and separated online with 2 h gradients by nano-scale C18 reversed-phase chromatography connected to a mass spectrometer through an electrospray source. The eluting peptides were analyzed on a tandem mass spectrometer operated in data-dependent acquisition mode. Results We identified a total of 35,664 unique peptides from 4,161 different proteins, of which 1,946 and 2,090 were of bacterial and human origin, respectively. The human protein profiles displayed significant overexpression of the complement system and inflammatory markers in periodontitis and dental caries compared to healthy controls. Bacterial proteome profiles and functional annotation were very similar in health and disease. Conclusions Overexpression of proteins related to the complement system and inflammation seems to correlate with oral disease status. Similar bacterial proteomes in healthy and diseased individuals suggests that the salivary microbiota predominantly thrives in a planktonic state expressing no disease-associated characteristics of metabolic activity.},

We therefore aimed to identify non-invasive microbial biomarkers, useful to implement diagnosis of poly-autoimmunity. Twenty CD patients with poly-autoimmunity (cases) and 30 matched subjects affected exclusively by CD (controls) were selected. All patients followed a varied gluten-free diet for at least 1 year. Fecal microbiota composition was characterized using bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing. Significant differences in gut microbiota composition between CD patients with and without poly-autoimmune disease were found using the edgeR algorithm. Spearman correlations between gut microbiota and clinical, demographic, and anthropometric data were also examined. A significant reduction of Bacteroides, Ruminococcus, and Veillonella abundances was found in CD patients with poly-autoimmunity compared to the controls. Bifidobacterium was specifically reduced in CD patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis and its abundance correlated negatively with abdominal circumference values in patients affected exclusively by CD. In addition, the duration of CD correlated with the abundance of Firmicutes (negatively) and Odoribacter (positively), whereas the abundance of Desulfovibrionaceae correlated positively with the duration of poly-autoimmunity. This study provides supportive evidence that specific variations of gut microbial taxa occur in CD patients with poly-autoimmune diseases. These findings open the way to future validation studies on larger cohorts, which might in turn lead to promising diagnostic applications.},

  abstract = {The gut microbiome plays a fundamental role in the human host's overall health by contributing key biological functions such as expanded metabolism and pathogen defense/immune control. In a healthy individual, the gut microbiome co-exists within the human host in a symbiotic, non-inflammatory relationship that enables mutual benefits, such as microbial degradation of indigestible food products into small molecules that the host can utilize, and enhanced pathogen defense. In abnormal conditions, such as Crohn's disease, this favorable metabolic relationship breaks down and a variety of undesirable activities result, including chronic inflammation and other health-related issues. It has been difficult, however, to elucidate the overall functional characteristics of this relationship because the microbiota can vary substantially in composition for healthy humans and possibly even more in individuals with gut disease conditions such as Crohn's disease. Overall, this suggests that microbial membership composition may not be the best way to characterize a phenotype. Alternatively, it seems to be more informative to examine and characterize the functional composition of a gut microbiome. Towards that end, this study examines 25 metaproteomes measured in several Crohn's disease patients' post-resection surgery across the course of 1\,year, in order to examine persistence of microbial taxa, genes, proteins, and metabolic functional distributions across time in individuals whose microbiome might be more variable due to the gut disease condition.},

These workflows are all challenging because of ambiguity in the identification stage; they either expand the search space and thus increase the ambiguity of identifications, or, in the case of DIA, they generate data that is inherently more ambiguous. In this context, machine learning-based predictive models are now generating considerable excitement in the field of proteomics because these predictive models hold great potential to drastically reduce the ambiguity in the identification process of the above-mentioned workflows. Indeed, the field has already produced classical machine learning and deep learning models to predict almost every aspect of a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) experiment. Yet despite all the excitement, thorough integration of predictive models in these challenging LC-MS workflows is still limited, and further improvements to the modeling and validation procedures can still be made. Therefore, highly promising recent machine learning developments in proteomics are pointed out in this viewpoint, alongside some of the remaining challenges.},

  abstract = {The inclusion of peptide retention time prediction promises to remove peptide identification ambiguity in complex liquid chromatography\textendash mass spectrometry identification workflows. However, due to the way peptides are encoded in current prediction models, accurate retention times cannot be predicted for modified peptides. This is especially problematic for fledgling open searches, which will benefit from accurate retention time prediction for modified peptides to reduce identification ambiguity. We present DeepLC, a deep learning peptide retention time predictor using peptide encoding based on atomic composition that allows the retention time of (previously unseen) modified peptides to be predicted accurately. We show that DeepLC performs similarly to current state-of-the-art approaches for unmodified peptides and, more importantly, accurately predicts retention times for modifications not seen during training. Moreover, we show that DeepLC's ability to predict retention times for any modification enables potentially incorrect identifications to be flagged in an open search of a wide variety of proteome data.},

  abstract = {Advances in high-throughput sequencing have resulted in a massive increase of RNA-Seq transcriptome data. However, the promise of rapid gene expression profiling in a specific tissue, condition, unicellular organism~or microbial community comes with new computational challenges. Owing to the limited availability of well-resolved reference genomes, de novo assembled (meta)transcriptomes have emerged as popular tools for investigating the gene repertoire of previously uncharacterized organisms. Yet, despite their potential, these datasets often contain fragmented or contaminant sequences, and their analysis remains difficult. To alleviate some of these challenges, we developed TRAPID 2.0, a web application for the fast and efficient processing of assembled transcriptome data. The initial processing phase performs a global characterization of the input data, providing each transcript with several layers of annotation, comprising structural, functional, and taxonomic information. The exploratory phase enables downstream analyses from the web application. Available analyses include the assessment of gene space completeness, the functional analysis and comparison of transcript subsets, and the study of transcripts in an evolutionary context. A comparison with similar tools highlights TRAPID's unique features. Finally, analyses performed within TRAPID 2.0 are complemented by interactive data visualizations, facilitating the extraction of new biological insights, as demonstrated with diatom community metatranscriptomes.},

Dozens of algorithms for this task exist, but all exploit only part of the acquired data to judge a peptide-to-spectrum match (PSM), ignoring important information such as the observed retention time and fragment ion peak intensity pattern. Moreover, only few identification algorithms allow open modification searches that can substantially increase peptide identifications. We here therefore introduce ionbot, a novel open modification search engine that is the first to fully merge machine learning with peptide identification. This core innovation brings the ability to include a much larger range of experimental data into PSM scoring, and even to adapt this scoring to the specifics of the data itself. As a result, ionbot substantially increases PSM confidence for open searches, and even enables a further increase in peptide identification rate of up to 12\% by also considering lower-ranked, co-eluting matches for a fragmentation spectrum. Moreover, the exclusive use of machine learning for scoring also means that any future improvements to predictive models for peptide behavior will also result in more sensitive and accurate peptide identification.},

  abstract = {Classical approaches for analyzing reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) data commonly require normalization before assessing differential expression (DE). Normalization often has a substantial effect on the interpretation and validity of the subsequent analysis steps, but at the same time it causes a reduction in variance and introduces dependence among the normalized outcomes. These effects can be substantial, however, they are typically ignored. Most normalization techniques and methods for DE focus on mean expression and are sensitive to outliers. Moreover, in cancer studies, for example, oncogenes are often only expressed in a subsample of the populations during sampling. This primarily affects the skewness and the tails of the distribution and the mean is therefore not necessarily the best effect size measure within these experimental setups. In our contribution, we propose an extension of the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test which incorporates a robust normalization, and the uncertainty associated with normalization is propagated into the final statistical summaries for DE. Our method relies on semiparametric regression models that focus on the probability P\{Y {$\leq$} Y'\}, where Y and Y' denote independent responses for different subject groups. This effect size is robust to outliers, while remaining informative and intuitive when DE affects the shape of the distribution instead of only the mean. We also extend our approach for assessing DE for multiple features simultaneously. Simulation studies show that the test has a good performance, and that it is very competitive with standard methods for this platform. The method is illustrated on two neuroblastoma studies.},

We call the data structure opportunistic since its space occupancy is decreased when the input is compressible and this space reduction is achieved at no significant slowdown in the query performance. More precisely, its space occupancy is optimal in an information-content sense because text T[1,u] is stored using O(H/sub k/(T))+o(1) bits per input symbol in the worst case, where H/sub k/(T) is the kth order empirical entropy of T (the bound holds for any fixed k). Given an arbitrary string P[1,p], the opportunistic data structure allows to search for the occurrences of P in T in O(p+occlog/sup /spl epsiv//u) time (for any fixed /spl epsiv/{$>$}0). If data are uncompressible we achieve the best space bound currently known (Grossi and Vitter, 2000); on compressible data our solution improves the succinct suffix array of (Grossi and Vitter, 2000) and the classical suffix tree and suffix array data structures either in space or in query time or both. We also study our opportunistic data structure in a dynamic setting and devise a variant achieving effective search and update time bounds. Finally, we show how to plug our opportunistic data structure into the Glimpse tool (Manber and Wu, 1994). The result is an indexing tool which achieves sublinear space and sublinear query time complexity.},

  abstract = {Although the composition of the human microbiome is now well-studied, the microbiota's {$>$}8 million genes and their regulation remain largely uncharacterized. This knowledge gap is in part because of the difficulty of acquiring large numbers of samples amenable to functional studies of the microbiota. We conducted what is, to our knowledge, one of the first human microbiome studies in a well-phenotyped prospective cohort incorporating taxonomic, metagenomic, and metatranscriptomic profiling at multiple body sites using self-collected samples. Stool and saliva were provided by eight healthy subjects, with the former preserved by three different methods (freezing, ethanol, and RNAlater) to validate self-collection. Within-subject microbial species, gene, and transcript abundances were highly concordant across sampling methods, with only a small fraction of transcripts ({$<$}5\%) displaying between-method variation. Next, we investigated relationships between the oral and gut microbial communities, identifying a subset of abundant oral microbes that routinely survive transit to the gut, but with minimal transcriptional activity there. Finally, systematic comparison of the gut metagenome and metatranscriptome revealed that a substantial fraction (41\%) of microbial transcripts were not differentially regulated relative to their genomic abundances. Of the remainder, consistently underexpressed pathways included sporulation and amino acid biosynthesis, whereas up-regulated pathways included ribosome biogenesis and methanogenesis. Across subjects, metatranscriptional profiles were significantly more individualized than DNA-level functional profiles, but less variable than microbial composition, indicative of subject-specific whole-community regulation. The results thus detail relationships between community genomic potential and gene expression in the gut, and establish the feasibility of metatranscriptomic investigations in subject-collected and shipped samples.},

  abstract = {The primary means of classifying new functions for genes and proteins relies on Gene Ontology (GO), which defines genes/proteins using a controlled vocabulary in terms of their Molecular Function, Biological Process and Cellular Component. The challenge is to present this information to researchers to compare and discover patterns in multiple datasets using visually comprehensible and user-friendly statistical reports. Importantly, while there are many GO resources available for eukaryotes, there are none suitable for simultaneous, graphical and statistical comparison between multiple datasets. In addition, none of them supports comprehensive resources for bacteria. By using Streptococcus pneumoniae as a model, we identified and collected GO resources including genes, proteins, taxonomy and GO relationships from NCBI, UniProt and GO organisations. Then, we designed database tables in PostgreSQL database server and developed a Java application to extract data from source files and loaded into database automatically. We developed a PHP web application based on Model-View-Control architecture, used a specific data structure as well as current and novel algorithms to estimate GO graphs parameters. We designed different navigation and visualization methods on the graphs and integrated these into graphical reports. This tool is particularly significant when comparing GO groups between multiple samples (including those of pathogenic bacteria) from different sources simultaneously. Comparing GO protein distribution among up- or down-regulated genes from different samples can improve understanding of biological pathways, and mechanism(s) of infection. It can also aid in the discovery of genes associated with specific function(s) for investigation as a novel vaccine or therapeutic targets. Availability http://turing.ersa.edu.au/BacteriaGO.},

Microarrays, the technology that first permitted this, were riddled with problems due to unwanted sources of variability. Many of these problems are now mitigated, after a decade's worth of statistical methodology development. The recently developed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) technology has generated much excitement in part due to claims of reduced variability in comparison to microarrays. However, we show that RNA-seq data demonstrate unwanted and obscuring variability similar to what was first observed in microarrays. In particular, we find guanine-cytosine content (GC-content) has a strong sample-specific effect on gene expression measurements that, if left uncorrected, leads to false positives in downstream results. We also report on commonly observed data distortions that demonstrate the need for data normalization. Here, we describe a statistical methodology that improves precision by 42\% without loss of accuracy. Our resulting conditional quantile normalization algorithm combines robust generalized regression to remove systematic bias introduced by deterministic features such as GC-content and quantile normalization to correct for global distortions.},

  abstract = {The production of biogas by anaerobic digestion (AD) of agricultural residues, organic wastes, animal excrements, municipal sludge, and energy crops has a firm place in sustainable energy production and bio-economy strategies. Focusing on the microbial community involved in biomass conversion offers the opportunity to control and engineer the biogas process with the objective to optimize its efficiency. Taxonomic profiling of biogas producing communities by means of high-throughput 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing provided high-resolution insights into bacterial and archaeal structures of AD assemblages and their linkages to fed substrates and process parameters. Commonly, the bacterial phyla Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes appeared to dominate biogas communities in varying abundances depending on the apparent process conditions. Regarding the community of methanogenic Archaea, their diversity was mainly affected by the nature and composition of the substrates, availability of nutrients and ammonium/ammonia contents, but not by the temperature. It also appeared that a high proportion of 16S rRNA sequences can only be classified on higher taxonomic ranks indicating that many community members and their participation in AD within functional networks are still unknown. Although cultivation-based approaches to isolate microorganisms from biogas fermentation samples yielded hundreds of novel species and strains, this approach intrinsically is limited to the cultivable fraction of the community. To obtain genome sequence information of non-cultivable biogas community members, metagenome sequencing including assembly and binning strategies was highly valuable. Corresponding research has led to the compilation of hundreds of metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) frequently representing novel taxa whose metabolism and lifestyle could be reconstructed based on nucleotide sequence information. In contrast to metagenome analyses revealing the genetic potential of microbial communities, metatranscriptome sequencing provided insights into the metabolically active community. Taking advantage of genome sequence information, transcriptional activities were evaluated considering the microorganism's genetic background. Metaproteome studies uncovered enzyme profiles expressed by biogas community members. Enzymes involved in cellulose and hemicellulose decomposition and utilization of other complex biopolymers were identified. Future studies on biogas functional microbial networks will increasingly involve integrated multi-omics analyses evaluating metagenome, transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome datasets.},

  abstract = {Motivation Inferring taxonomy in mass spectrometry-based shotgun proteomics is a complex task. In multi-species or viral samples of unknown taxonomic origin, the presence of proteins and corresponding taxa must be inferred from a list of identified peptides which is often complicated by protein homology: many proteins do not only share peptides within a taxon but also between taxa. However, correct taxonomic identification is crucial when identifying different viral strains with high sequence homology \textendash{} considering, e.g., the different epidemiological characteristics of the various strains of SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, many viruses mutate frequently, further complicating the correct assignment of virus proteomic samples. Results We present PepGM, a probabilistic graphical for the taxonomic assignment of virus proteomic samples with strain-level resolution and associated confidence scores. PepGM combines the results of a standard proteomic database search algorithm with belief propagation to calculate the marginal distributions, and thus confidence score, for potential taxonomic assignments. We demonstrate the performance of PepGM using several publicly available virus proteomic datasets, showing its strain-level resolution performance. In two out of eight cases, the taxonomic assignments were only correct on species level, which PepGM clearly indicates by lower confidence scores.

  abstract = {Metagenomics is the study of the genomic content of a sample of organisms obtained from a common habitat using targeted or random sequencing. Goals include understanding the extent and role of microbial diversity. The taxonomical content of such a sample is usually estimated by comparison against sequence databases of known sequences. Most published studies use the analysis of paired-end reads, complete sequences of environmental fosmid and BAC clones, or environmental assemblies. Emerging sequencing-by-synthesis technologies with very high throughput are paving the way to low-cost random ``shotgun'' approaches. This paper introduces MEGAN, a new computer program that allows laptop analysis of large metagenomic data sets. In a preprocessing step, the set of DNA sequences is compared against databases of known sequences using BLAST or another comparison tool. MEGAN is then used to compute and explore the taxonomical content of the data set, employing the NCBI taxonomy to summarize and order the results. A simple lowest common ancestor algorithm assigns reads to taxa such that the taxonomical level of the assigned taxon reflects the level of conservation of the sequence. The software allows large data sets to be dissected without the need for assembly or the targeting of specific phylogenetic markers. It provides graphical and statistical output for comparing different data sets. The approach is applied to several data sets, including the Sargasso Sea data set, a recently published metagenomic data set sampled from a mammoth bone, and several complete microbial genomes. Also, simulations that evaluate the performance of the approach for different read lengths are presented.},

  abstract = {Studies of the human microbiome have revealed that even healthy individuals differ remarkably in the microbes that occupy habitats such as the gut, skin and vagina. Much of this diversity remains unexplained, although diet, environment, host genetics and early microbial exposure have all been implicated. Accordingly, to characterize the ecology of human-associated microbial communities, the Human Microbiome Project has analysed the largest cohort and set of distinct, clinically relevant body habitats so far. We found the diversity and abundance of each habitat's signature microbes to vary widely even among healthy subjects, with strong niche specialization both within and among individuals. The project encountered an estimated 81\textendash 99\% of the genera, enzyme families and community configurations occupied by the healthy Western microbiome. Metagenomic carriage of metabolic pathways was stable among individuals despite variation in community structure, and ethnic/racial background proved to be one of the strongest associations of both pathways and microbes with clinical metadata. These results thus delineate the range of structural and functional configurations normal in the microbial communities of a healthy population, enabling future characterization of the epidemiology, ecology and translational applications of the human microbiome.},

  abstract = {Metaproteomics characterizes proteins expressed by microorganism communities (microbiome) present in environmental samples or a host organism (e.g. human), revealing insights into the molecular functions conferred by these communities. Compared to conventional proteomics, metaproteomics presents unique data analysis challenges, including the use of large protein databases derived from hundreds or thousands of organisms, as well as numerous processing steps to ensure high data quality. These challenges limit the use of metaproteomics for many researchers. In response, we have developed an accessible and flexible metaproteomics workflow within the Galaxy bioinformatics framework. Via analysis of human oral tissue exudate samples, we have established a modular Galaxy-based workflow that automates a reduction method for searching large sequence databases, enabling comprehensive identification of host proteins (human) as well as ``meta-proteins'' from the nonhost organisms. Downstream, automated processing steps enable basic local alignment search tool analysis and evaluation/visualization of peptide sequence match quality, maximizing confidence in results. Outputted results are compatible with tools for taxonomic and functional characterization (e.g. Unipept, MEGAN5). Galaxy also allows for the sharing of complete workflows with others, promoting reproducibility and also providing a template for further modification and enhancement. Our results provide a blueprint for establishing Galaxy as a solution for metaproteomic data analysis. All MS data have been deposited in the ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD001655 (http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/dataset/PXD001655).},

The higher order functional information is stored in the PATHWAY database, which contains graphical representations of cellular processes, such as metabolism, membrane transport, signal transduction and cell cycle. The PATHWAY database is supplemented by a set of ortholog group tables for the information about conserved subpathways (pathway motifs), which are often encoded by positionally coupled genes on the chromosome and which are especially useful in predicting gene functions. A third database in KEGG is LIGAND for the information about chemical compounds, enzyme molecules and enzymatic reactions. KEGG provides Java graphics tools for browsing genome maps, comparing two genome maps and manipulating expression maps, as well as computational tools for sequence comparison, graph comparison and path computation.

This review discusses the opportunities and limitations of selected techniques in soil-, and leaf litter metaproteomics, and presents a step-by-step guideline on their application, covering sampling, sample preparation, extraction and data evaluation strategies. In addition, we present recent applications of soil metaproteomics and discuss how such approaches, linking phylogenetics and functionality, can help gain deeper insights into terrestrial microbial ecology. Finally, we strongly recommend that to maximize the insights environmental metaproteomics may provide, such methods should be employed within a holistic experimental approach considering relevant aboveground and belowground ecosystem parameters.},

  abstract = {Finding approximate occurrences of a pattern in a text using a full-text index is a central problem in bioinformatics and has been extensively researched. Bidirectional indices have opened new possibilities in this regard allowing the search to start from anywhere within the pattern and extend in both directions. In particular, use of search schemes (partitioning the pattern and searching the pieces in certain orders with given bounds on errors) can yield significant speed-ups. However, finding optimal search schemes is a difficult combinatorial optimization problem. Here for the first time, we propose a mixed integer program (MIP) capable to solve this optimization problem for Hamming distance with given number of pieces. Our experiments show that the optimal search schemes found by our MIP significantly improve the performance of search in bidirectional FM-index upon previous ad-hoc solutions. For example, approximate matching of 101-bp Illumina reads (with two errors) becomes 35 times faster than standard backtracking. Moreover, despite being performed purely in the index, the running time of search using our optimal schemes (for up to two errors) is comparable to the best state-of-the-art aligners, which benefit from combining search in index with in-text verification using dynamic programming. As a result, we anticipate a full-fledged aligner that employs an intelligent combination of search in the bidirectional FM-index using our optimal search schemes and in-text verification using dynamic programming outperforms today's best aligners. The development of such an aligner, called FAMOUS (Fast Approximate string Matching using OptimUm search Schemes), is ongoing as our future work.},

In this perspective, I provide a brief overview of the questions that we can currently address, as well as new metaproteomics-based approaches that we and others are developing to address even more questions in the study of microbial communities and plant and animal microbiota.

It can also be difficult to keep pace with rapidly expanding biological knowledge, which often results in daily changes to any of the over 47,000 gene ontologies that describe biological knowledge. GOATOOLS, a Python-based library, makes it more efficient to stay current with the latest ontologies and annotations, perform gene ontology enrichment analyses to determine over- and under-represented terms, and organize results for greater clarity and easier interpretation using a novel GOATOOLS GO grouping method. We performed functional analyses on both stochastic simulation data and real data from a published RNA-seq study to compare the enrichment results from GOATOOLS to two other popular tools: DAVID and GOstats.

A core step of these applications is to align an enormous amount of short reads to a reference genome. For example, to resequence a human genome, billions of reads of 35 bp are produced in 1-2 weeks, putting a lot of pressure of faster software for alignment. Based on existing indexing and pattern matching technologies, several short read alignment software have been developed recently. Yet this is still strong need to further improve the speed. In this paper, we show a new indexing data structure called bi-directional BWT, which allows us to build the fastest software for aligning short reads. When compared with existing software (Bowtie is the best), our software is at least 3 times faster for finding unique best alignments, and 25 times faster for finding all possible alignments. We believe that bi-directional BWT is an interesting data structure on its own and could be applied to other pattern matching problems.},

It provides the minimal list of proteins or phosphosites that are present in a set of samples using grouping algorithms based on the principle of parsimony. Regarding proteins, a two-level classification is performed, where groups gather proteins sharing at least one peptide and subgroups gather proteins that are not distinguishable according to the identified peptides. Regarding phosphosites, an innovative approach based on the concept of phosphoisland is used to gather overlapping phosphopeptides. The graphical interface of X!TandemPipeline allows the users to launch X!tandem identification, to inspect spectra and to manually validate their assignment to peptides, to launch the grouping program, and to visualize elementary data as well as grouping and redundancy information. Identification results obtained from other search engines can also be processed. X!TandemPipeline results can be exported as ready-to-use tabulated files or as XML files that can be directly used by the PROTICdb database or by the MassChroQ quantification software.

  abstract = {Many analyses of the human gut microbiome depend on a catalog of reference genes. Existing catalogs for the human gut microbiome are based on samples from single cohorts or on reference genomes or protein sequences, which limits coverage of global microbiome diversity. Here we combined 249 newly sequenced samples of the Metagenomics of the Human Intestinal Tract (MetaHit) project with 1,018 previously sequenced samples to create a cohort from three continents that is at least threefold larger than cohorts used for previous gene catalogs. From this we established the integrated gene catalog (IGC) comprising 9,879,896 genes. The catalog includes close-to-complete sets of genes for most gut microbes, which are also of considerably higher quality than in previous catalogs. Analyses of a group of samples from Chinese and Danish individuals using the catalog revealed country-specific gut microbial signatures. This expanded catalog should facilitate quantitative characterization of metagenomic, metatranscriptomic and metaproteomic data from the gut microbiome to understand its variation across populations in human health and disease.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Metaproteomics is an established method to obtain a comprehensive taxonomic and functional view of microbial communities. After more than a decade, we are now able to describe the promise, reality, and perspectives of metaproteomics and provide useful information about the choice of method, applications, and potential improvement strategies.Areas covered: In this article, we will discuss current challenges of species and proteome coverage, and also highlight functional aspects of metaproteomics analysis of microbial communities with different levels of complexity. To do this, we re-analyzed data from microbial communities with low to high complexity (8, 72, 200 and {$>$}300 species). High species diversity leads to a reduced number of protein group identifications in a complex community, and thus the number of species resolved is underestimated. Ultimately, low abundance species remain undiscovered in complex communities. However, we observed that the main functional categories were better represented within complex microbiomes when compared to species coverage.Expert opinion: Our findings showed that even with low species coverage, metaproteomics has the potential to reveal habitat-specific functional features. Finally, we exploit this information to highlight future research avenues that are urgently needed to enhance our understanding of taxonomic composition and functions of complex microbiomes.},

The taxonomic composition of microbial communities varies substantially between environments, but the ecological causes of this variation remain largely unknown. We analyzed taxonomic and functional community profiles to determine the factors that shape marine bacterial and archaeal communities across the global ocean. By classifying {$>$}30,000 marine microorganisms into metabolic functional groups, we were able to disentangle functional from taxonomic community variation. We find that environmental conditions strongly influence the distribution of functional groups in marine microbial communities by shaping metabolic niches, but only weakly influence taxonomic composition within individual functional groups. Hence, functional structure and composition within functional groups constitute complementary and roughly independent ``axes of variation'' shaped by markedly different processes.},

  abstract = {Biological reconstruction of allografts and recycled autografts have been widely implemented in high-grade osteogenic sarcoma. For treating tumor-bearing autografts, extracorporeal irradiation (ECIR) and liquid nitrogen (LN) freezing techniques are being used worldwide as a gold standard treatment procedure. Both the methods aim to eradicate the tumor cells from the local recurrence and restore the limb function. Therefore, it is essential and crucial to find, and compare the alterations at molecular and physiological levels of the treated and untreated OGS recycled autografts to obtain valuable clinical information for better clinical practice. Thus, we aimed to investigate the significantly expressed altered proteins from ECIR-and cryotherapy/freezing- treated OGS (n\,=\,12) were compared to untreated OGS (n\,=\,12) samples using LC-ESI-MS/MS analysis, and the selected proteins from this protein panel were verified using immunoblot analysis. From our comparative proteomic analysis identified a total of 131 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) from OGS. Among these, 91 proteins were up-regulated (2.5 to 3.5-folds), and 40 proteins were down-regulated (0.2 to 0.5 folds) (p\,{$<$}\,0.01 and 0.05). The functional enrichment analysis revealed that the identified DEPs have belonged to more than 10 different protein categories include cytoskeletal, extracellular matrix, immune, enzyme modulators, and cell signaling molecules. Among these, we have confirmed two potential candidates' expressions levels such as Fibronectin and Protein S100 A4 using western blot analysis. Our proteomic study revealed that LN-freezing and ECIR treatments are effectively eradicating tumor cells, and reducing the higher expressions of DEPs at molecular levels which may help in restoring the limb functions of~OGS autografts effectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first proteomic study that compared proteomic profiles among freezing, ECIR treated~with untreated OGS in recycled autografts. Moreover, the verified proteins could be used as prognostic or diagnostic markers that reveal valuable scientific information which may open various therapeutic avenues in clinical practice to improve patient outcomes.},

However, the peptide-centric nature of shotgun proteomics complicates the analysis and biological interpretation of the data especially in the case of higher eukaryote organisms. The same peptide sequence can be present in multiple different proteins or protein isoforms. Such shared peptides therefore can lead to ambiguities in determining the identities of sample proteins. In this article we illustrate the difficulties of interpreting shotgun proteomic data and discuss the need for common nomenclature and transparent informatic approaches. We also discuss related issues such as the state of protein sequence databases and their role in shotgun proteomic analysis, interpretation of relative peptide quantification data in the presence of multiple protein isoforms, the integration of proteomic and transcriptional data, and the development of a computational infrastructure for the integration of multiple diverse datasets.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Diet is a key factor influencing gut microbiota (GM) composition and functions, which in turn affect host health. Among dietary regimens, time-restricted (TR) feeding has been associated to numerous health benefits. The impact of TR feeding on the GM composition has been mostly explored by means of metagenomic sequencing. To date, however, little is known about the modulation of GM functions by this dietary regimen. Here, we analyzed the effects of TR feeding on GM functions by evaluating protein expression changes in a rat model through a metaproteomic approach. We observed that TR feeding has a relevant impact on GM functions, specifically leading to an increased abundance of several enzymes involved in carbohydrate and protein metabolism and expressed by Lactobacillus spp. and Akkermansia muciniphila. Taken together, these results contribute to deepening our knowledge about the key relationship between diet, GM, and health.},

In the last 3~years, public data sharing through PRIDE (as part of PX) has definitely become the norm in the field. In parallel, data re-use of public proteomics data has increased enormously, with multiple applications. We first describe the new architecture of PRIDE Archive, the archival component of PRIDE. PRIDE Archive and the related data submission framework have been further developed to support the increase in submitted data volumes and additional data types. A new scalable and fault tolerant storage backend, Application Programming Interface and web interface have been implemented, as a part of an ongoing process. Additionally, we emphasize the improved support for quantitative proteomics data through the mzTab format. At last, we outline key statistics on the current data contents and volume of downloads, and how PRIDE data are starting to be disseminated to added-value resources including Ensembl, UniProt and Expression Atlas.},

  abstract = {This thesis addresses important algorithms and data structures used in sequence analysis for applications such as read mapping. First, we give an overview on state-of-the-art FM indices and present the latest improvements. In particular, we will introduce a recently published FM index based on a new data structure: EPR dictionaries. This rank data structures allows search steps in constant time for unidirectional and bidirectional FM indices. To our knowledge this is the first and only constant-time implementation of a bidirectional FM index at the time of writing. We show that its running time is not only optimal in theory, but currently also outperforms all available FM index implementations in practice.
 
 Second, we cover approximate string matching in bidirectional indices. To improve the running time and make higher error rates suitable for index-based searches, we introduce an integer linear program for finding optimal search strategies. We show that it is significantly faster than other search strategies in indices and cover additional improvements such as hybrid approaches of index-based searches with in-text verification, i.e., at some point the partially matched string is located and verified directly in the text.
 
 Finally, we present a yet unpublished algorithm for fast computation of the mappability of genomic sequences. Mappability is a measure for the uniqueness of a genome by counting how often each \$k\$-mer of the sequence occurs with a certain error threshold in the genome itself. We suggest two applications of mappability with prototype implementations: First, a read mapper incorporating the mappability information to improve the running time when mapping reads that match highly repetitive regions, and second, we use the mappability information to identify phylogenetic markers in a set of similar strains of the same species by the example of E. coli. Unique regions allow identifying and distinguishing even highly similar strains using unassembled sequencing data.
 
 The findings in this thesis can speed up many applications in bioinformatics as we demonstrate for read mapping and computation of mappability, and give suggestions for further research in this field.},

  abstract = {In this study, the impact of protein fractionation techniques prior to LC/MS analysis was investigated on activated sludge samples derived at winter and summer condition from a full-scale wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). For reduction of the sample complexity, different fractionation techniques including RP-LC (1D-approach), SDS-PAGE and RP-LC (2D-approach) as well as RP-LC, SDS-PAGE and liquid IEF (3D-approach) were carried out before subsequent ion trap MS analysis. The derived spectra were identified by MASCOT search using a combination of the public UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot protein database and metagenome data from a WWTP. The results showed a significant increase of identified spectra, enabled by applying IEF and SDS-PAGE to the proteomic workflow. Based on meta-proteins, a core metaproteome and a corresponding taxonomic profile of the wastewater activated sludge were described. Functional aspects were analyzed using the KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathway library by plotting KEGG Orthology identifiers (KO numbers) of protein hits into pathway maps of the central carbon (map01200) and nitrogen metabolism (map00910). Using the 3D-approach, most proteins involved in glycolysis and citrate cycle and nearly all proteins of the nitrogen removal were identified, qualifying this approach as most promising for future studies. All MS data have been deposited in the ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD001547 (http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/dataset/PXD001547).},

Metaproteomics is also attracting considerable attention, and such data can be efficiently generated today owing to improvements in mass spectrometry-based proteomics. As we will discuss in this study, there are still major challenges notably in data analysis that need to be overcome. Here, we analyzed 212 fecal samples from 56 hospitalized acute leukemia patients with multidrug-resistant Enterobactericeae (MRE) gut colonization using metagenomics and metaproteomics. This is one of the largest clinical metaproteomic studies to date, and the first metaproteomic study addressing the gut microbiome in MRE colonized acute leukemia patients. Based on this substantial data set, we discuss major current limitations in clinical metaproteomic data analysis to provide guidance to researchers in the field. Notably, the results show that public metagenome databases are incomplete and that sample-specific metagenomes improve results. Furthermore, biological variation is tremendous which challenges clinical study designs and argues that longitudinal measurements of individual patients are a valuable future addition to the analysis of patient cohorts.},

  abstract = {Metaproteomics is the characterization of all proteins being expressed by a community of organisms in a complex biological sample at a single point in time. Applications of metaproteomics range from the comparative analysis of environmental samples (such as ocean water and soil) to microbiome data from multicellular organisms (such as the human gut). Metaproteomics research is often focused on the quantitative functional makeup of the metaproteome and which organisms are making those proteins. That is: What are the functions of the currently expressed proteins? How much of the metaproteome is associated with those functions? And, which microorganisms are expressing the proteins that perform those functions? However, traditional protein-centric functional analysis is greatly complicated by the large size, redundancy, and lack of biological annotations for the protein sequences in the database used to search the data. To help address these issues, we have developed an algorithm and web application (dubbed ``MetaGOmics'') that automates the quantitative functional (using Gene Ontology) and taxonomic analysis of metaproteomics data and subsequent visualization of the results. MetaGOmics is designed to overcome the shortcomings of traditional proteomics analysis when used with metaproteomics data. It is easy to use, requires minimal input, and fully automates most steps of the analysis\textemdash including comparing the functional makeup between samples.

One of the fundamental data analysis tasks, especially for gene expression studies, involves determining whether there is evidence that counts for a transcript or exon are significantly different across experimental conditions. edgeR is a Bioconductor software package for examining differential expression of replicated count data. An overdispersed Poisson model is used to account for both biological and technical variability. Empirical Bayes methods are used to moderate the degree of overdispersion across transcripts, improving the reliability of inference. The methodology can be used even with the most minimal levels of replication, provided at least one phenotype or experimental condition is replicated. The software may have other applications beyond sequencing data, such as proteome peptide count data.Availability: The package is freely available under the LGPL licence from the Bioconductor web site (http://bioconductor.org).Contact: ~mrobinson@wehi.edu.au},

We have now a foreseeable future in which most bacterial species will have an annotated genome. However, we know also that most prokaryotic diversity would not be included there. On the one hand, there is the problem of many groups not being easily amenable to culture and hence not represented in culture-centred microbial taxonomy. On the other hand, the gene pools present in one species can be orders of magnitude larger that the genome of one strain (selected for genome sequencing). Contrasting with eukaryotic genomes, the repertoire of genes present in one prokaryotic cell genome does not correlate stringently with its taxonomic identity. Hence gene catalogues from one environment might provide more meaningful information than the classical species catalogues. Metagenomics or microbial environmental genomics provide a different tool that gravitates around the habitat rather than the species. Such tool could be just the right way to complement `organismal genomics'. Its potential to advance our understanding of microbial ecology and prokaryotic diversity and evolution is discussed.},

Future methodological developments could provide new capabilities such as characterizing long-term ecosystem changes, biogeochemical reaction rates, and in situ stoichiometries.

This can be accomplished through metaproteomics, which characterizes the protein expression of microbiomes. Several software tools exist for analyzing microbiomes at the functional level by measuring their combined proteome-level response to environmental perturbations. In this survey, we explore the performance of six available tools, to enable researchers to make informed decisions regarding software choice based on their research goals. Tandem mass spectrometry-based proteomic data obtained from dental caries plaque samples grown with and without sucrose in paired biofilm reactors were used as representative data for this evaluation. Microbial peptides from one sample pair were identified by the X! tandem search algorithm via SearchGUI and subjected to functional analysis using software tools including eggNOG-mapper, MEGAN5, MetaGOmics, MetaProteomeAnalyzer (MPA), ProPHAnE, and Unipept to generate functional annotation through Gene Ontology (GO) terms. Among these software tools, notable differences in functional annotation were detected after comparing differentially expressed protein functional groups. Based on the generated GO terms of these tools we performed a peptide-level comparison to evaluate the quality of their functional annotations. A BLAST analysis against the NCBI non-redundant database revealed that the sensitivity and specificity of functional annotation varied between tools. For example, eggNOG-mapper mapped to the most number of GO terms, while Unipept generated more accurate GO terms. Based on our evaluation, metaproteomics researchers can choose the software according to their analytical needs and developers can use the resulting feedback to further optimize their algorithms. To make more of these tools accessible via scalable metaproteomics workflows, eggNOG-mapper and Unipept 4.0 were incorporated into the Galaxy platform.},

  abstract = {Dendrograms are graphical representations of binary tree structures resulting from~agglomerative hierarchical clustering. In Life Science, a cluster heat map is a widely~accepted visualization technique that utilizes the leaf order of a dendrogram to reorder~the rows and columns of the data table. The derived linear order is more~meaningful than a random order, because it groups similar items together. However,~two consecutive items can be quite dissimilar despite proximity in the order.~In addition, there are 2 n-1 possible orderings given n input elements as the orientation~of clusters at each merge can be flipped without affecting the hierarchical~structure. We present two modular leaf ordering methods to encode both the monotonic order in which clusters are merged and the nested cluster relationships more~faithfully in the resulting dendrogram structure. We compare dendrogram and cluster~heat map visualizations created using our heuristics to the default heuristic in~R and seriation-based leaf ordering methods. We find that our methods lead to a~dendrogram structure with global patterns that are easier to interpret, more legible~given a limited display space, and more insightful for some cases. The implementation~of methods is available as an R package, named ''dendsort'', from the CRAN~package repository. Further examples, documentations, and the source code are~available at [https://bitbucket.org/biovizleuven/dendsort/].},

Indeed, a peptide sequence can be present not only in multiple proteins or protein isoforms of the same species, but also in homologous proteins from closely related species. To assign the taxonomy and functions of the microbial species, specialized tools have been developed, such as Prophane. This tool, however, is not directly compatible with post-processing tools such as Percolator. In this manuscript we therefore present Pout2Prot, which takes Percolator Output (.pout) files from multiple experiments and creates protein group and protein subgroup output files (.tsv) that can be used directly with Prophane. We investigated different grouping strategies and compared existing protein grouping tools to develop an advanced protein grouping algorithm that offers a variety of different approaches, allows grouping for multiple files, and uses a weighted spectral count for protein (sub)groups to reflect abundance. Pout2Prot is available as a web application at https://pout2prot.ugent.be and is installable via pip as a standalone command line tool and reusable software library.

After five days of continuous cultivation, we investigated the influence of different medium TT of 12 h, 24 h, and 48 h. For profiling the microbial community, we applied flow cytometric fingerprinting and revealed changes in the community structure of SIHUMIx during the change of TT, which were not associated with changes in species abundances. For pinpointing metabolic alterations, we applied metaproteomics and metabolomics and found, along with shortening the TT, a slight decrease in glycan biosynthesis, carbohydrate, and amino acid metabolism and, furthermore, a reduction in butyrate, methyl butyrate, isobutyrate, valerate, and isovalerate concentrations. Specifically, B. thetaiotaomicron was identified to be affected in terms of butyrate metabolism. However, communities could recover to the original state afterward. This study shows that SIHUMIx showed high structural stability when TT changed\textemdash even four-fold. Resistance values remained high, which suggests that TTs did not interfere with the structure of the community to a certain degree.},

In particular, it focuses on the creation of tailored protein sequence databases, on the optimal use of database search algorithms including methods of error rate estimation, and finally on taxonomic and functional annotation of peptide and protein identifications.Expert opinion: Recently, various promising strategies and software tools have been proposed for handling typical data analysis issues in metaproteomics. However, severe challenges remain that are highlighted and discussed in this article; these include: (i) robust false-positive assessment of peptide and protein identifications, (ii) complex protein inference against a background of highly redundant data, (iii) taxonomic and functional post-processing of identification data, and finally, (iv) the assessment and provision of metrics and tools for quantitative analysis.},

  abstract = {Metaproteomics, the study of the collective protein composition of multi-organism systems, provides deep insights into the biodiversity of microbial communities and the complex functional interplay between microbes and their hosts or environment. Thus, metaproteomics has become an indispensable tool in various fields such as microbiology and related medical applications. The computational challenges in the analysis of corresponding datasets differ from those of pure-culture proteomics, e.g., due to the higher complexity of the samples and the larger reference databases demanding specific computing pipelines. Corresponding data analyses usually consist of numerous manual steps that must be closely synchronized. With MetaProteomeAnalyzer and Prophane, we have established two open-source software solutions specifically developed and optimized for metaproteomics. Among other features, peptide-spectrum matching is improved by combining different search engines and, compared to similar tools, metaproteome annotation benefits from the most comprehensive set of available databases (such as NCBI, UniProt, EggNOG, PFAM, and CAZy). The workflow described in this protocol combines both tools and leads the user through the entire data analysis process, including protein database creation, database search, protein grouping and annotation, and results visualization. To the best of our knowledge, this protocol presents the most comprehensive, detailed and flexible guide to metaproteomics data analysis to date. While beginners are provided with robust, easy-to-use, state-of-the-art data analysis in a reasonable time (a few hours, depending on, among other factors, the protein database size and the number of identified peptides and inferred proteins), advanced users benefit from the flexibility and adaptability of the workflow.},

Our pairwise analysis of 93,481 bacterial genomes identified 138,273 HGT events. We developed a model to explain their statistical properties as well as estimate the transfer rate between pairs of taxa. This reveals that long-distance HGT is frequent: our results indicate that HGT between species from different phyla has occurred in at least 8\% of the species. Finally, our results confirm that the function of sequences strongly impacts their transfer rate, which varies by more than three orders of magnitude between different functional categories. Overall, we provide a comprehensive view of HGT, illuminating a fundamental process driving bacterial evolution.},

  abstract = {Metaproteomics enables the investigation of the protein repertoire expressed by complex microbial communities. However, to unleash its full potential, refinements in bioinformatic approaches for data analysis are still needed. In this context, sequence databases selection represents a major challenge. This work assessed the impact of different databases in metaproteomic investigations by using a mock microbial mixture including nine diverse bacterial and eukaryotic species, which was subjected to shotgun metaproteomic analysis. Then, both the microbial mixture and the single microorganisms were subjected to next generation sequencing to obtain experimental metagenomic- and genomic-derived databases, which were used along with public databases (namely, NCBI, UniProtKB/SwissProt and UniProtKB/TrEMBL, parsed at different taxonomic levels) to analyze the metaproteomic dataset. First, a quantitative comparison in terms of number and overlap of peptide identifications was carried out among all databases. As a result, only 35\% of peptides were common to all database classes; moreover, genus/species-specific databases provided up to 17\% more identifications compared to databases with generic taxonomy, while the metagenomic database enabled a slight increment in respect to public databases. Then, database behavior in terms of false discovery rate and peptide degeneracy was critically evaluated. Public databases with generic taxonomy exhibited a markedly different trend compared to the counterparts. Finally, the reliability of taxonomic attribution according to the lowest common ancestor approach (using MEGAN and Unipept software) was assessed. The level of misassignments varied among the different databases, and specific thresholds based on the number of taxon-specific peptides were established to minimize false positives. This study confirms that database selection has a significant impact in metaproteomics, and provides critical indications for improving depth and reliability of metaproteomic results. Specifically, the use of iterative searches and of suitable filters for taxonomic assignments is proposed with the aim of increasing coverage and trustworthiness of metaproteomic data.},

However, little is known regarding the functions exerted by the GM in colon cancer (CC), particularly with respect to tumor clinical classification and lymphocyte infiltration. In addition, stool, usually employed as a proxy of the GM, cannot fully represent the original complexity of CC microenvironment. Here, we present a pilot study aimed at characterizing the metaproteome of CC-associated colonic luminal contents and identifying its possible associations with CC clinicopathological features. Colonic luminal contents were collected from 24 CC tissue specimens immediately after surgery. Samples were analyzed by shotgun metaproteomics. Almost 30,000 microbial peptides were quantified in the samples, enabling the achievement of the taxonomic and functional profile of the tumor-associated colonic luminal metaproteome. Upon sample aggregation based on tumor stage, grade, or tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), peptide sets enabling discrimination of sample groups were identified through discriminant analysis (DA). As a result, Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides fragilis were significantly enriched in high-stage and high-grade CC, respectively. Among metabolic functions, formate\textendash tetrahydrofolate ligase was significantly associated with high-stage CC. Finally, based on the results of this pilot study, we assessed the optimal sample size for differential metaproteomic studies analyzing colonic luminal contents. In conclusion, we provide a detailed picture of the microbial and host components of the colonic luminal proteome and propose promising associations between GM taxonomic/functional features and CC clinicopathological features. Future studies will be needed to verify the prognostic value of these data and to fully exploit the potential of metaproteomics in enhancing our knowledge concerning CC progression.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The study of the gut microbiota (GM) is rapidly moving towards its functional characterization by means of shotgun meta-omics. In this context, there is still no consensus on which microbial functions are consistently and constitutively expressed in the human gut in physiological conditions. Here, we selected a cohort of 15 healthy subjects from a native and highly monitored Sardinian population and analyzed their GMs using shotgun metaproteomics, with the aim of investigating GM functions actually expressed in a healthy human population. In addition, shotgun metagenomics was employed to reveal GM functional potential and to compare metagenome and metaproteome profiles in a combined taxonomic and functional fashion. RESULTS: Metagenomic and metaproteomic data concerning the taxonomic structure of the GM under study were globally comparable. On the contrary, a considerable divergence between genetic potential and functional activity of the human healthy GM was observed, with the metaproteome displaying a higher plasticity, compared to the lower inter-individual variability of metagenome profiles. The taxon-specific contribution to functional activities and metabolic tasks was also examined, giving insights into the peculiar role of several GM members in carbohydrate metabolism (including polysaccharide degradation, glycan transport, glycolysis, and short-chain fatty acid production). Noteworthy, Firmicutes-driven butyrogenesis (mainly due to Faecalibacterium spp.) was shown to be the metabolic activity with the highest expression rate and the lowest inter-individual variability in the study cohort, in line with the previously reported importance of the biosynthesis of this microbial product for the gut homeostasis. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide detailed and taxon-specific information regarding functions and pathways actively working in a healthy GM. The reported discrepancy between expressed functions and functional potential suggests that caution should be used before drawing functional conclusions from metagenomic data, further supporting metaproteomics as a fundamental approach to characterize the human GM metabolic functions and activities.},

Founded in 1998, GO has become widely adopted in the life sciences, and its contents are under continual improvement, both in quantity and in quality. Here, we report the major developments of the GO resource during the past two years. Each monthly release of the GO resource is now packaged and given a unique identifier (DOI), enabling GO-based analyses on a specific release to be reproduced in the future. The molecular function ontology has been refactored to better represent the overall activities of gene products, with a focus on transcription regulator activities. Quality assurance efforts have been ramped up to address potentially out-of-date or inaccurate annotations. New evidence codes for high-throughput experiments now enable users to filter out annotations obtained from these sources. GO-CAM, a new framework for representing gene function that is more expressive than standard GO annotations, has been released, and users can now explore the growing repository of these models. We also provide the `GO ribbon' widget for visualizing GO annotations to a gene; the widget can be easily embedded in any web page.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Protein quantification by label-free shotgun proteomics experiments is plagued by a multitude of error sources. Typical pipelines for identifying differential proteins use intermediate filters to control the error rate. However, they often ignore certain error sources and, moreover, regard filtered lists as completely correct in subsequent steps. These two indiscretions can easily lead to a loss of control of the false discovery rate (FDR). We propose a probabilistic graphical model, \emph{Triqler}, that propagates error information through all steps, employing distributions in favor of point estimates, most notably for missing value imputation. The model outputs posterior probabilities for fold changes between treatment groups, highlighting uncertainty rather than hiding it. We analyzed 3 engineered data sets and achieved FDR control and high sensitivity, even for truly absent proteins. In a bladder cancer clinical data set we discovered 35 proteins at 5\% FDR, whereas the original study discovered 1 and MaxQuant/Perseus 4 proteins at this threshold. Compellingly, these 35 proteins showed enrichment for functional annotation terms, whereas the top ranked proteins reported by MaxQuant/Perseus showed no enrichment.

Different search engines yield different PSMs and thus different protein lists. Analysis of results from one or multiple search engines is often hampered by different data exchange formats and lack of convenient and intuitive user interfaces. We present PIA, a flexible software suite for combining PSMs from different search engine runs and turning these into consistent results. PIA can be integrated into proteomics data analysis workflows in several ways. A user-friendly graphical user interface can be run either locally or (e.g., for larger core facilities) from a central server. For automated data processing, stand-alone tools are available. PIA implements several established protein inference algorithms and can combine results from different search engines seamlessly. On several benchmark data sets, we show that PIA can identify a larger number of proteins at the same protein FDR when compared to that using inference based on a single search engine. PIA supports the majority of established search engines and data in the mzIdentML standard format. It is implemented in Java and freely available at https://github.com/mpc-bioinformatics/pia.},

Based on well-established workflows, we evaluate the effect of sample preparation, mass spectrometry, and bioinformatic analysis using two samples: a simplified, laboratory-assembled human intestinal model and a human fecal sample. We observe that variability at the peptide level is predominantly due to sample processing workflows, with a smaller contribution of bioinformatic pipelines. These peptide-level differences largely disappear at the protein group level. While differences are observed for predicted community composition, similar functional profiles are obtained across workflows. CAMPI demonstrates the robustness of present-day metaproteomics research, serves as a template for multi-laboratory studies in metaproteomics, and provides publicly available data sets for benchmarking future developments.},

While initially focused on the study of biodiversity within these communities, the emphasis has increasingly shifted to the study of (changes in) the complete set of functions available in these communities. A key tool to study this functional complement of a microbiome is Gene Ontology (GO) term analysis. However, comparing large sets of GO terms is not an easy task due to the deeply branched nature of GO, which limits the utility of exact term matching. To solve this problem, we here present MegaGO, a user-friendly tool that relies on semantic similarity between GO terms to compute the functional similarity between multiple data sets. MegaGO is high performing: Each set can contain thousands of GO terms, and results are calculated in a matter of seconds. MegaGO is available as a web application at https://megago.ugent.be and is installable via pip as a standalone command line tool and reusable software library. All code is open source under the MIT license and is available at https://github.com/MEGA-GO/.},

  abstract = {Unipept is an ecosystem of tools developed for fast metaproteomics data-analysis consisting of a web application, a set of web services (application programming interface, API) and a command-line interface (CLI). After the successful introduction of version 4 of the Unipept web application, we here introduce version 2.0 of the API and CLI. Next to the existing taxonomic analysis, version 2.0 of the API and CLI provides access to Unipept's powerful functional analysis for metaproteomics samples. The functional analysis pipeline supports retrieval of Enzyme Commission numbers, Gene Ontology terms and InterPro entries for the individual peptides in a metaproteomics sample. This paves the way for other applications and developers to integrate these new information sources into their data processing pipelines, which greatly increases insight into the functions performed by the organisms in a specific environment. Both the API and CLI have also been expanded with the ability to render interactive visualizations from a list of taxon ids. These visualizations are automatically made available on a dedicated website and can easily be shared by users.The API is available at http://api.unipept.ugent.be. Information regarding the CLI can be found at https://unipept.ugent.be/clidocs. Both interfaces are freely available and open-source under the MIT license.pieter.verschaffelt@ugent.beSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  abstract = {Unipept Desktop 2.0 is the most recent iteration of the Unipept Desktop tool that adds support for the analysis of proteogenomics datasets. Unipept Desktop now supports the automatic construction of targeted protein reference databases that only contain proteins associated with a predetermined list of taxa. This improves both the taxonomic and functional resolution of a metaproteomic analysis and yields several technical advantages. By limiting the proteins present in a reference database, it is now also possible to perform (meta)proteogenomics analyses. Since the protein reference database now lives on the user's local machine, they have complete control over the database used during an analysis. Data does no longer need to be transmitted over the internet, decreasing the time required for an analysis and better safeguarding privacy sensitive data. As a proof of concept, we present a case study in which a human gut metaproteome dataset is analyzed with Unipept Desktop 2.0 using different targeted databases based on matched 16S rRNA gene sequencing data.},

One widely used tool for metaproteomics data interpretation is Unipept, a web-based tool that provides, among others, interactive and insightful visualizations. Due to its web-based implementation, however, the Unipept web application is limited in the amount of data that can be analyzed. In this manuscript we therefore present Unipept Desktop, a desktop application version of Unipept that is designed to drastically increase the throughput and capacity of metaproteomics data analysis. Moreover, it provides a novel comparative analysis pipeline and improves the organization of experimental data into projects, thus addressing the growing need for more efficient and versatile analysis tools for metaproteomics data.},

However, searching a short pattern in a text with high error rates (10\textendash 20\%) under the Levenshtein distance is a task for which few efficient solutions exist. Here we address this problem by introducing a new type of seeds: the 01⁎0 seeds. These seeds are made of two exact parts separated by parts with exactly one error. We show that those seeds are lossless, and we apply them to two filtration algorithms for two popular applications, one where a compressed index is built on the text and another one where the patterns are indexed. We also demonstrate experimentally the advantages of our approach compared to alternative methods implementing other types of seeds. This work opens the way to the design of more efficient and more sensitive text algorithms.},

Researchers are employing various approaches to efficiently predict the GO terms. Meanwhile, deep learning, a fast-evolving discipline in data-driven approach, exhibits impressive potential with respect to assigning GO terms to amino acid sequences. Herein, we reviewed the currently available computational GO annotation methods for proteins, ranging from conventional to deep learning approach. Further, we selected some suitable predictors from among the reviewed tools and conducted a mini comparison of their performance using a worldwide challenge dataset. Finally, we discussed the remaining major challenges in the field, and emphasized the future directions for protein function prediction with GO.},

In microbiology, these `omic' approaches have largely been limited to pure cultures of microorganisms. Consequently, they do not provide information on gene expression in a complex mixture of microorganisms as found in the environment. Our method enabled the successful extraction and purification of the entire proteome from a laboratory-scale activated sludge system optimized for enhanced biological phosphorus removal, its separation by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and the mapping of this metaproteome. Highly expressed protein spots were excised and identified using quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry with de novo peptide sequencing. The proteins isolated were putatively identified as an outer membrane protein (porin), an acetyl coenzyme A acetyltransferase and a protein component of an ABC-type branched-chain amino acid transport system. These proteins possibly stem from the dominant and uncultured Rhodocyclus-type polyphosphate-accumulating organism in the activated sludge. We propose the term `metaproteomics' for the large-scale characterization of the entire protein complement of environmental microbiota at a given point in time.},

Metaproteomics offers the ability to resolve the major catalytic units of microbial populations and thereby allows the establishment of genotype-phenotype linkages from in situ samples. A decade has passed since the term ``metaproteomics'' was first coined and corresponding analyses were carried out on mixed microbial communities. Since then metaproteomics has yielded many important insights into microbial ecosystem function in the various environmental settings where it has been applied. Although initial progress in analytical capacities and resulting numbers of proteins identified was extremely fast, this trend slowed rapidly. Here, we discuss several representative metaproteomic investigations of activated sludge, acid mine drainage biofilms, freshwater and seawater microbial communities, soil, and human gut microbiota. By using these case studies, we highlight current challenges and possible solutions for metaproteomics to realize its full potential, i.e. to enable conclusive links between microbial community composition, physiology, function, interactions, ecology, and evolution in situ.},

We examined how such proteins partition into soluble urine (SU) and urinary pellet (UP) fractions by analyzing 33 urine specimens 12 of which were associated with a urinary tract infection (UTI). Using mass spectrometry-based metaproteomic approaches, we identified 5,327 non-redundant human proteins, 2,638 and 4,379 of which were associated with SU and UP fractions, respectively, and 1,206 non-redundant protein orthology groups derived from pathogenic and commensal organisms of the urogenital tract. Differences between the SU and UP proteomes were influenced by local inflammation, supported by respective comparisons with 12 healthy control urine proteomes. Clustering analyses showed that SU and UP fractions had proteomic signatures discerning UTIs, vascular injury, and epithelial cell exfoliation from the control group to varying degrees. Cases of UTI revealed clusters of proteins produced by activated neutrophils. Network analysis supported the central role of neutrophil effector proteins in the defense against invading pathogens associated with subsequent coagulation and wound repair processes. Our study expands the existing knowledge of the urinary proteome under perturbed conditions, and should be useful as reference dataset in the search of biomarkers.},
