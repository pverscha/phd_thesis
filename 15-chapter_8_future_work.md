## Future work
\markright{\textsf{The future of Unipept}}
No scientific work is ever complete and there remains a lot of challenges in the field of metaproteomics and proteogenomics that still need to be solved. In this section, I discuss some issues and challenges that currently arise and what needs to be overcome in order to solve these.

### Modelling the inherent ambiguities in the Unipept matching system

### Identification and analysis of arbitrary peptides, including variants

### Towards a meta-, multi-omics Unipept

### Differential analysis of metaproteomics data
